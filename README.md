Project was generated using `@angular/cli` and the `Apollo app schematics`:

- `ng new apollo-app`
- `ng add @angular/material`
- `ng generate @angular/material:material-table --name table`
- `ng add apollo-angular`

Implementation is then a couple of settings and putting the right HTML tags in place. From there on the coding starts.

# Installation and running the app
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

For the Pok√©mon api you will also need in a seperate window:
- `git clone https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon.git`
- `yarn`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn start`

# Learned

- Apollo is really cool, with built-in RxJS support it ties in easily with existing Angular applications.
